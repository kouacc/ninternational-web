# Mario Kart Wii

This page is just a test. You will find nothing interesting here.
It is mostly used to test fonts and headings.

## Why should you look at this page?

I don't know. If you're visiting this website, you probably want to see what it looks like. So here you go.
If you're disappointed, I'm so sorry. But you could just send me recommendations.

### Ok, and now?

You could just go to the [homepage](/) or to the [projects page](/projects).

#### What is Astro?

Astro is a cool web framework, basically advanced HTML but with cool-ass features.
